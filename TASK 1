Q1. Create a function which will take a list as an argument and return the product of all the numbers
after creating a flat list.
Use the below-given list as an argument for your function.
list1 = [1,2,3,4, [44,55,66, True], False, (34,56,78,89,34), {1,2,3,3,2,1}, {1:34, "key2": [55, 67, 78, 89], 4: (45,
22, 61, 34)}, [56, 'data science'], 'Machine Learning']
Note: you must extract numeric keys and values of the dictionary also.

ANS.  def flatten_and_calculate_product(lst):
    flat_list = []
    def flatten(lst):
        for item in lst:
            if type(item) in (list, tuple, set, dict):
                flatten(item)
            elif type(item) in (int, float):
                flat_list.append(item)
    flatten(lst)
    product = 1
    for num in flat_list:
        product *= num
    return product

list1 = [1,2,3,4, [44,55,66, True], False, (34,56,78,89,34), {1,2,3,3,2,1}, {1:34, "key2": [55, 67, 78, 89], 4: (45, 22, 61, 34)}, [56, 'data science'], 'Machine Learning']
result = flatten_and_calculate_product(list1)
print(result)







Q2. Write a python program for encrypting a message sent to you by your friend. The logic of encryption
should be such that, for a the output should be z. For b, the output should be y. For c, the output should
be x respectively. Also, the whitespace should be replaced with a dollar sign. Keep the punctuation
marks unchanged.
Input Sentence: I want to become a Data Scientist.
Encrypt the above input sentence using the program you just created.
ANS. 
def encrypt(sentence):
    encrypted = ""
    for char in sentence:
        if char.isalpha():
            char = chr(122 - ord(char.lower()) + 97)
        elif char.isspace():
            char = "$"
        encrypted += char
    return encrypted

input_sentence = "I want to become a Data Scientist."
encrypted_sentence = encrypt(input_sentence)
print("Encrypted Sentence:", encrypted_sentence)
